Note that in this folder we are creating RI coeffs of the density response
for  a periodic calculation with DFPT dielectric. Change to DFPT polarizability
for non-periodic systems.

The workflow for the ML learning and prediction is then the same as for the other examples.
Only the data generation and the calculation of derived quantities (reading in RI coefficients)
is different in FHI-aims and the files in this folder cover these aspects.
